## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 30%

Class participation: 15%

Course project: 55%

## Homeworks

There will be four homework assignments near the beginning of the course for students to familiarize themselves with some of the image processing tools used throughout the course, as well as provide some guiding exercises for developing their final projects.

This quarter, we will be piloting JupyterHub for content delivery and homework submission. Students will have an individual server to which they can log in to access lecture materials and homework assignments. The server can be accessed via a browser (Chrome and Firefox recommended) using your UWNetID credentials. The server comes with all the software packages you will need to complete the homework pre-installed, saving you all that headache.

All homeworks will be Python-based in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks allow you to weave both code and text (in the form of Markdown) into a single cohesive document. You can find an introduction to Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and Latex (for equations) [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)).

All homeworks are due at midnight on the day specified.

## GitHub Tools

We will be using GitHub to manage course projects. Your homework assignments will gradually introduce you to some of the features of GitHub. Please see instructions for installing Git [here](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-10-01-uw/).

Here are a few tutorial videos on some of the tools available to you using GitHub:

* [Using Markdown to create documents](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=50dfe599-d18a-4ff1-b209-ab1b010947f8)
* [Version control with GitHub](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0fb31d40-91fb-48b8-9bc9-ab1b010d6507)

## A note about collaboration

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work. Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

We will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on weekly project summaries. These are informal 2-3 minute presentations outlining what was accomplished in the previous week, any roadblocks that were encountered, and goals for the following week as well as soliciting any help from other teams.

Project summaries should be accompanied by the teams GitHub Projects page. This page can be used to track project tasks in different stages of completion, as well as assign tasks to team members. This should be updated weekly during the course of the quarter.

## Course Project

This course is a project-based course. Students will propose projects in the second week of the course based on data from their research or publicly available datasets in a topic of interest. **Students must have access to a dataset before selecting a project**. After project proposals have been made in the second week, students can form teams of 2-4 students to carry out the project for the rest of the quarter.

If you have a paucity of image data, there are many open image datasets available. Check out a few of these for inspiration:

1. Federal agencies such as [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/browse)
2. Journals that publish open data like [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)
3. Datasets available through university libraries, such as our own [UW ResearchWorks](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/)

Final projects should be organized into a Github repo taking using a mixture of Markdown, Python, and Jupyter notebook files. The project should be well-documented, including function descriptions and tutorials. Teams are encouraged to use the Github Wiki pages to develop their documentation (see [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for an excellent resource in developing high-quality documentation). The UW eScience-developed [Shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) package is also a good tool, and is meant to be used as a template for developing new software packages.

Final projects will culminate in a presentation at the end of the quarter. Presentations will be graded on the use of image processing tools, good software practices, and presentation. A rubric for the final project can be found [here](https://github.com/uw-cheme599/uw-cheme599.github.io/raw/master/Presentation_Rubric.doc).

Final presentation organization and design are up to the students' discretion, but should include at minimum:

1. Problem setup and introduction: What problem is the team seeking to address? Where does this fit in the field? What datasets is the team using?
2. Methods: What pre-existing packages, modules, functions etc. is the team using to address the problem? What novel tools did the team develop to address the problem?
3. Results and Discussion: Was the team able to address the problem as originally specified? What modifications were made, if any?

Final projects will be graded as a group effort. Students will be able to give input on team member contributions through a team evaluation survey. Team members will be given 100 points to allot among all team members e.g. if you think all team members contributed equally and you are in a team of 3, you would give each team member 33.3 points.
