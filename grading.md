## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 30%

Class participation: 15%

Course project: 55%

## Homeworks

There will be four homework assignments near the beginning of the course for students to familiarize themselves with some of the image processing tools used throughout the course, as well as provide some guiding exercises for developing their final projects.

Homeworks will be submitted via Github classroom in the form of a GitHub repository. All written work should be submitted in the repo README.md file using Markdown and Latex (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)) or as a Jupyter notebook.

Please see instructions for installing Git [here](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-10-01-uw/). See a video tutorial for submitting homework assignments with Git [here](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=847f11be-1154-4c41-9d10-aaff0122ebd7).

Students will be able to resubmit homeworks to be regraded. All homeworks are due at midnight on the day specified.

## A note about collaboration

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work. Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

We will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on weekly project summaries. These are informal 2-3 minute presentations outlining what was accomplished in the previous week, any roadblocks that were encountered, and goals for the following week as well as soliciting any help from other teams.

## Course Project

This course is a project-based course. Students will propose projects in the second week of the course based on data from their research or publicly available datasets in a topic of interest. **Students must have access to a dataset before selecting a project**. After project proposals have been made in the second week, students can form teams of 2-4 students to carry out the project for the rest of the quarter.

Final projects will culminate in a presentation at the end of the quarter. Presentations will be graded on the use of image processing tools, good software practices, and presentation. A rubric for the final project can be found here.

Final projects will be graded as a group effort. Students will be able to give input on team member contributions through a team evaluation survey. Team members will be given 100 points to allot among all team members e.g. if you think all team members contributed equally and you are in a team of 3, you would give each team member 33.3 points.
