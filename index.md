## Course Description and Objectives:

Are images or videos a key dataset in some of your research workflows? Image datasets are increasingly important in many fields of research including microscopy, medical imaging, oceanography, and astronomy. While images can provide qualitative information, it can often be difficult to extract quantitative information from images, especially when prioritizing reproducibility.

In this course, students will be introduced to a number of image processing and analysis tools using Python libraries such as sci-kit image. These methods will address a number of use cases including:

* **Image description**: Developing descriptors of features from datasets to quantitatively summarize information contained in them.
* **Image transforms**: Image transforms such as the Fourier transform or the wavelet transform can be used in many image analysis workflows.
* **Image morphology**: Identifying shapes and features within an image and calculating geometrical- and intensity-based properties.
* **Image registration**: Aligning images with a common frame of reference, such as images taken in different z-planes or images with different fluorophores.
* **Object recognition and machine learning**: Images can also be used in machine learning algorithms to do complex tasks such as identifying objects within an image.

## Conduct

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable by students as they pursue their academic goals. In particular, please review the definitions of academic misconduct found [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) and [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html#7). In the context of ChemE 599, it is expected that all work, homework and otherwise, is the students' own work. Students should also not use unauthorized materials during exams. Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by the College of Engineering.

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to both me and the teaching team. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as early as possible so we can discuss your needs in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts) you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interaction process with you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with state and federal law.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/) available on this site.
