## Textbook

The course material is based on *Digital Image Processing* (Gonzalez and Woods) 2 ed. The most recent edition (4 ed.) is available, but the 2nd can be found [here](http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/home/astro_refs/Digital_Image_Processing_2ndEd.pdf) online.

The textbook website can be found [here](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/).

Note that the textbook uses MatLab, but we will be doing all coding with Python.
